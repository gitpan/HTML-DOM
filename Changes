Revision history for HTML::DOM

0.004   22 July, 2007
        Fixed infinite recursion triggered by element handlers calling
        $dom_tree->write($html)  when  $html contains elements handled
        by the same handler. E.g.,
        <script>document.write('<script>...<\/script>')</script>

      - HTML::DOM::Text now has its nodeValue method, which I forgot
        about before. (Actually, I moved HTML::DOM::Comment's
        nodeValue to HTML::DOM::CharacterData.)
      - as_text and as_HTML have been overridden and now work.

        The basic mechanism for event handling has been implemented.
        The various different flavours of event objects still  need
        to be added.

        The first version. So far, most of the level-1 core DOM is
        implemented,  and a couple of HTML-specific  methods,  but
        that's all.
