Revision history for HTML::DOM

And the rest of the HTMLDocument interface.

0.005   26 August, 2007
        The HTMLCollection interface has now been implemented, and so
        have the attribute  methods  of  the  HTMLDocument  interface
        (Level 1). The HTMLHtmlElement, HTMLHeadElement,
        HTMLLinkElement, HTMLTitleElement, HTMLMetaElement,
        HTMLBaseElement, HTMLIsIndexElement, HTMLStyleElement and
        HTMLBodyElement interfaces (again, Level 1) have also been
        implemented.

        Fixed infinite recursion triggered by element handlers calling
        $dom_tree->write($html)  when  $html contains elements handled
        by the same handler. E.g.,
        <script>document.write('<script>...<\/script>')</script>

      - HTML::DOM::Text now has its nodeValue method, which I forgot
        about before. (Actually, I moved HTML::DOM::Comment's
        nodeValue to HTML::DOM::CharacterData.)
      - as_text and as_HTML have been overridden and now work.

0.002   9 July, 2007
        The basic mechanism for event handling has been implemented.
        The various different flavours of event objects still  need
        to be added.

        The first version. So far, most of the level-1 core DOM is
        implemented,  and a couple of HTML-specific  methods,  but
        that's all.
