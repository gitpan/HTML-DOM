Revision history for HTML::DOM

0.009   23 November, 2007
        Changes/new features:
        *  You can do something with errors produced by event handlers
           by passing a coderef to the new event_handler method.  That
           coderef will be called for each error. (Before, such errors
           were ignored.)
        *  HTML::DOM::Interface has been modified, such that
          'Document' is no longer a separate interface--since there is
           no corresponding HTML::DOM module--,  but all  its  members
           are  now under HTMLDocument,  which inherits directly  from
           Node. Likewise, 'Element' has been merged into HTMLElement.
        *  HTML::DOM::Element::Select now has 'add' and
          'remove' methods.
        * 'Select' elements can now be used as array refs, so you can
           write $select->[0] instead of $select->options->[0].
        *  You can now assign undef to such an array element to delete
           it,  so  '$select->[0] = undef'  does  the  same  thing  as
          'shift @$select'. 'delete $select->[0]' also works.
        Bug fixes:
        * $form->action now works when the document has no base url
          (used to die)
        * HTML::DOM::Element::Select's type method now works.
        * HTML::DOM::Element::Select's  selectedIndex  method  and
          HTML::DOM::Element::Option's selected method should work
          reliably now.
        * HTML::DOM::Collection::Options is now listed by
          HTML::DOM::Interface.
        * HTML::DOM::Element::Input's click method now returns an
          empty list.
        * HTML::DOM's event_attr_handler is now actually useful. (It
          used to be ignored most of the time.)

0.008   5 October, 2007
        * New HTML::DOM::Interface module
        * Added type and value methods to HTML::DOM::Element::Button
        * Added the charset, coords and tabIndex methods to 
          HTML::DOM::Element::A.
        * HTML::DOM's createElement method now throws an 
          HTML::DOM::Exception.

0.007   29 September, 2007
        Two bug fixes:
        * The URL method no longer warns if there is no URL.
        * The previous release broke parsing of forms. (The rest of
          the document would be within the form element.) Now it
          should work.

0.006   27 September, 2007
      - The following interfaces have been implemented:
            HTMLFormElement
            HTMLSelectElement
            HTMLOptGroupElement
            HTMLOptionElement
            HTMLInputElement
            HTMLTextAreaElement
            HTMLButtonElement
            HTMLLabelElement
            HTMLFieldSetElement
            HTMLLegendElement
            HTMLUListElement
            HTMLOListElement
            HTMLDListElement
            HTMLDirectoryElement
            HTMLMenuElement
            HTMLLIElement
            HTMLDivElement
            HTMLParagraphElement
            HTMLHeadingElement
            HTMLQuoteElement
            HTMLPreElement
            HTMLBRElement
            HTMLBaseFontElement
            HTMLFontElement
            HTMLHRElement
            HTMLModElement
            HTMLAnchorElement
            HTMLImageElement
            HTMLObjectElement
            HTMLParamElement
            HTMLAppletElement
            HTMLMapElement
            HTMLAreaElement
            HTMLScriptElement
      - Some methods have also been added for compatibility with 
        WWW::Mechanize.
      - The 'open' method no longer stops the ownerDocument method
        from working properly.
      - Furthermore,  'open' is no longer anywhere near as powerful as
        it was; it used to obliterate the coderefs that were passed to
        event_attr_handler and default_event_handler.
      - &HTML::DOM::base has been added.
      - The parse and eof methods have been deleted, since write and
        close do the same thing.

0.005   26 August, 2007
        The HTMLCollection interface has now been implemented, and so
        have the attribute  methods  of  the  HTMLDocument  interface
        (Level 1). The HTMLHtmlElement, HTMLHeadElement,
        HTMLLinkElement, HTMLTitleElement, HTMLMetaElement,
        HTMLBaseElement, HTMLIsIndexElement, HTMLStyleElement and
        HTMLBodyElement interfaces (again, Level 1) have also been
        implemented.

0.004   22 July, 2007
        Fixed infinite recursion triggered by element handlers calling
        $dom_tree->write($html)  when  $html contains elements handled
        by the same handler. E.g.,
        <script>document.write('<script>...<\/script>')</script>

0.003   15 July, 2007
      - HTML::DOM::Text now has its nodeValue method, which I forgot
        about before. (Actually, I moved HTML::DOM::Comment's
        nodeValue to HTML::DOM::CharacterData.)
      - as_text and as_HTML have been overridden and now work.

0.002   9 July, 2007
        The basic mechanism for event handling has been implemented.
        The various different flavours of event objects still  need
        to be added.

0.001   27 June, 2007
        The first version. So far, most of the level-1 core DOM is
        implemented,  and a couple of HTML-specific  methods,  but
        that's all.
