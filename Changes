            HTMLHeadingElement
            HTMLQuoteElement
            HTMLPreElement
            HTMLBRElement
            HTMLBaseFontElement
            HTMLFontElement
            HTMLHRElement
            HTMLModElement
            HTMLAnchorElement
            HTMLImageElement
            HTMLObjectElement
            HTMLParamElement
            HTMLAppletElement
            HTMLMapElement
            HTMLAreaElement
            HTMLScriptElement
      - Some methods have also been added for compatibility with 
        WWW::Mechanize.
      - The 'open' method no longer stops the ownerDocument method
        from working properly.
      - Furthermore,  'open' is no longer anywhere near as powerful as
        it was; it used to obliterate the coderefs that were passed to
        event_attr_handler and default_event_handler.
      - &HTML::DOM::base has been added.
      - The parse and eof methods have been deleted, since write and
        close do the same thing.

        The HTMLCollection interface has now been implemented, and so
        have the attribute  methods  of  the  HTMLDocument  interface
        (Level 1). The HTMLHtmlElement, HTMLHeadElement,
        HTMLLinkElement, HTMLTitleElement, HTMLMetaElement,
        HTMLBaseElement, HTMLIsIndexElement, HTMLStyleElement and
        HTMLBodyElement interfaces (again, Level 1) have also been
        implemented.

        Fixed infinite recursion triggered by element handlers calling
        $dom_tree->write($html)  when  $html contains elements handled
        by the same handler. E.g.,
        <script>document.write('<script>...<\/script>')</script>

      - HTML::DOM::Text now has its nodeValue method, which I forgot
        about before. (Actually, I moved HTML::DOM::Comment's
        nodeValue to HTML::DOM::CharacterData.)
      - as_text and as_HTML have been overridden and now work.

        The basic mechanism for event handling has been implemented.
        The various different flavours of event objects still  need
        to be added.

        The first version. So far, most of the level-1 core DOM is
        implemented,  and a couple of HTML-specific  methods,  but
        that's all.
