HTML::DOM, version 0.020

HTML::DOM is a Perl implementation of the HTML Document Object Model

This is an alpha release.  So far,  the  level-2  core  and  HTML  DOM
interfaces have been implemented, most of the level-2 event interfaces
and some of the level-2 style sheet interfaces.


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

Incompatible changes:
• HTML::DOM’s defaultView attribute no longer has anything assigned
  to it by default.
• The defaultView attribute now holds a weak reference to the view,
  and the view holds a strong reference to the document.

New features:
• HTML::DOM now has an event_parent method, with which you can add an
  object to the top of the event dispatch chain.
• HTML::DOM::NodeList::Magic’s constructor is now officially public.
  Use this if  you  need  to  create  a  custom  ‘live’  node  list.
• HTML::DOM  now has an  event_listeners_enabled  method  that  allows
  event handlers to be disabled. Also, any subclass of EventTarget can
  implement this to achieve the same effect.

Bug fixes:
• innerHTML no longer dies when there are event attributes in the HTML
  code fed to it.
And a couple of minor fixes. See the Changes file.
