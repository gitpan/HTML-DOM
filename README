HTML::DOM, version 0.005

HTML::DOM is a Perl implementation of the HTML Document Object Model

This is an alpha release.  So far, most of the level-1 core DOM is
implemented, some of the level-1 HTML and level-2 event interfaces.


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

The HTMLDocument interface (Level 1) has been completed, and several
other interfaces have been added (see the Changes file for the list).
What this means is that:
- the 'write' method now works after the tree has been built
  (replaces it),
- the 'open' and 'close' methods have been implemented, too,
- cookies are now supported
- and many element attributes can now be accessed through corresponding
  methods, in addition to the generic get/setAttribute methods.


TO DO

- Finish Level 1 HTML support
- Add Level 2 Core support
- Add Level 2 HTML support
- Finish Level 2 Events support
- Add Level 2 CSS support
- etc.
- Make HTML::DOM::Element::Form compatible with HTML::Form
- Write more complete documentation


INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install this module is to use the CPAN module or
the cpan script:

    [sudo] perl -MCPAN -e "install HTML::DOM"

    [sudo] cpan HTML::DOM

Or you can use the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    [sudo] make install


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires perl 5.6.0 or later (only tested with 5.8.7 and
5.8.8) and the following Perl modules:

- HTML::TreeBuilder and HTML::Element (both part of the HTML::Tree
  distribution) (tested with 3.23)
- URI
- HTTP::Headers::Util is required for writing cookies.

Later it will require other modules (including some CSS modules).


DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the 
perldoc command.

    perldoc HTML::DOM

Or try using man (it's faster, in my experience):

    man HTML::DOM
