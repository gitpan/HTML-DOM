HTML::DOM, version 0.052

HTML::DOM is a Perl implementation of the HTML Document Object Model

This is an alpha release.  So far,  the level-2 core,  HTML and event
DOM interfaces have been implemented,  and some of the level-2  style
sheet interfaces.

Bug fixes:
• An extraneous  <body>  tag no longer  closes  currently  open  tags,

  Thanks to Tomki Camp for the report.

  die when there is no body element.

ument has no root element.
