HTML::DOM, version 0.011

HTML::DOM is a Perl implementation of the HTML Document Object Model

This is an alpha release.  So far,  the level-1 DOM interfaces and the
level-2 core interfaces have been implemented, and some of the level-2
event and style sheet interfaces.


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

New features:
• Link and style elements now have their ‘sheet’ attribute (in other
  words, the LinkStyle interface has been added).
• HTML::DOM now has a C<styleSheets> method (the DocumentStyle inter-
  face has been implemented).
One bug fix:
• The so-called ‘content_offset’ bug (RT #34404) has been fixed. It
  actually had nothing to do with content_offset (which merely exposed
  the bug), but text after the </html> tag that was inserted in the
  document, rather than the HTML element.


TO DO

- Add support to HTML::DOM::Interface for UTF-16 methods.
- Weaken upward references
- Add Level 2 HTML support
- Finish Level 2 Events support
- Finish Level 2 CSS support
- etc.
- Write more complete documentation
- Write more tests
