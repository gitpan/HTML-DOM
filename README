HTML::DOM, version 0.008

HTML::DOM is a Perl implementation of the HTML Document Object Model

This is an alpha release.  So far, most of the level-1 DOM interfaces
are implemented, and some of the level-2 event interfaces.


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

- There is a new HTML::DOM::Interface module, which lists the sup-
  ported interface methods in a machine-readable format  (a hash).
- Added type and value methods to HTML::DOM::Element::Button
- Added the charset, coords and tabIndex methods to
  HTML::DOM::Element::A
- HTML::DOM's createElement method now throws an HTML::DOM::Exception.


TO DO

- Finish Level 1 HTML support
- Add Level 2 Core support
- Add Level 2 HTML support
- Finish Level 2 Events support
- Add Level 2 CSS support
- etc.
- Write more complete documentation
- Write more tests


INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install this module is to use the CPAN module or
the cpan script:

    [sudo] perl -MCPAN -e "install HTML::DOM"

    [sudo] cpan HTML::DOM

Or you can use the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    [sudo] make install


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires perl 5.8.3 or later (only tested with 5.8.7 and
5.8.8) and the following Perl modules:

- HTML::TreeBuilder and HTML::Element (both part of the HTML::Tree
  distribution) (tested with 3.23)
- URI (tested with 1.35)
- HTTP::Headers::Util is required for writing cookies.
- HTML::Form 1.054 is required if any of the methods provided for
  WWW::Mechanize compatibility are to be used.

Later it will require other modules (including some CSS modules).


DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the 
perldoc command.

    perldoc HTML::DOM

Or try using man (it's faster, in my experience):

    man HTML::DOM
