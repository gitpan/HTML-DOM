HTML::DOM, version 0.003

HTML::DOM is a Perl implementation of the HTML Document Object Model

This is an alpha release.  So far, most of the level-1 core DOM is
implemented,  a couple of HTML-specific methods,  and some of  the
level-2 DOM event interfaces.


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

as_text and as_HTML now work. See the Changes file for more.


TO DO

- Add Level 1 HTML support
- Add Level 2 Core support
- Add Level 2 HTML support
- Finish Level 2 Events support
- Add Level 2 CSS support
- etc.
- Make HTML::DOM::Element::Form compatible with HTML::Form
- Write more complete documentation


INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install this module is to use the CPAN module or
the cpan script:

    [sudo] perl -MCPAN -e "install HTML::DOM"

    [sudo] cpan HTML::DOM

Or you can use the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    [sudo] make install


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires Perl 5.6.0 or later (only tested with 5.8.7 and
5.8.8)  and HTML::TreeBuilder and HTML::Element  (both part  of  the
HTML::Tree distribution) (tested with 3.23).

Later it will require other modules (including some CSS modules).


DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the 
perldoc command.

    perldoc HTML::DOM

Or try using man (it's faster, in my experience):

    man HTML::DOM
