HTML::DOM, version 0.029

HTML::DOM is a Perl implementation of the HTML Document Object Model

This is an alpha release. So far, the level-2 core HTML and event DOM
interfaces have been implemented, and some of the level-2 style sheet
interfaces.


RECENT CHANGES

See the Changes file for the long version.

0.029
-----
HTML::DOM::Element::Form’s elements method,  when called in list cont-
ext,  was ignoring the magic associations added in the  previous  ver-
sion. Thanks to Terry Simons once more, for the bug report.

0.028
-----
When  HTML  code contains something like  <td><form><td><input>,  the
<input> is now associated with the <form>. Thanks to Terry Simons for
bringing this to my attention.

0.027
-----
• HTMLEvents
• Node lists are correctly updated when the write method is called.
