HTML::DOM, version 0.040

HTML::DOM is a Perl implementation of the HTML Document Object Model

This is an alpha release.  So far,  the level-2 core,  HTML and event
DOM interfaces have been implemented,  and some of the level-2  style
sheet interfaces.


RECENT CHANGES

See the Changes file for the long version.

0.040
-----

Bug fix: Calling $doc->write from an elem handler now parses the HTML
code immediately instead of buffering it and waiting for the elem han-
dler to return. This allows aberrations like
  $doc->write("<img id='img1'); $doc->getElementById('img')...
to work.

0.039
-----
Submitting a GET form with a data:  URL  (or any URI object without a
query_form method) now just uses the URL itself,  discarding any data.

0.038
-----
Bug fix:  A run-time require  that was causing problems in taint mode
has been removed.


TO DO

- Finish Level 2 CSS support
- outerHTML/innerText?
- Other DOM interfaces (the rest of level 2, and level 3)
- HTML 5 stuff
- Write more complete documentation
- Write more tests
- Finishing checking for memory leaks (run all tests under
  Devel::Leak::Object)
