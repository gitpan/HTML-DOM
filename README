HTML::DOM, version 0.054

HTML::DOM is a Perl implementation of the HTML Document Object Model

This is an alpha release.  So far,  the level-2 core,  HTML and event
DOM interfaces have been implemented,  and some of the level-2  style
sheet interfaces.


RECENT CHANGES

See the Changes file for the long version.

0.054
-----
New feature:  The named node map returned by $element->attributes can
now be used as an array or hash reference.  This also means that Java-
Script code run by WWW::Scripter can do form.attributes[x].value, etc.

0.053
-----
Bug fixes:
• An extraneous  <body>  tag with  event  attributes  now  calls  the
  event_attr_handler on the body, not the preceding tag, and actually
  supplies the value of the attribute,  rather than undef (RT #75997).
  Thanks again to Tomki Camp for the report.
• DOMAttrModified  events now always have their type and  cancellabil-
  ity set correctly.

0.052
-----
Bug fixes:
• An extraneous  <body>  tag no longer  closes  currently  open  tags,
  turning <form><body><input> into  <form></form><input>  (RT #75997).
  Thanks to Tomki Camp for the report.
• The weird colour methods of the document (fgColor,  etc.) no longer
  die when there is no body element.
