HTML::DOM, version 0.019

HTML::DOM is a Perl implementation of the HTML Document Object Model

This is an alpha release.  So far,  the level-2 core and  HTML  DOM
interfaces have been implemented, and some of the level-2 event and
style sheet interfaces.


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

New feature:
  EventTarget is now listed as a separate interface in
  %H:D:Interface.

Whether you call this a bug fix or a new feature is up to you:
  The DOM Level 0 methods for accessing HTML attributes  now  trigger
  DOMAttrModified events. (So mutation events are finished; the imple-
  mentation object also claims to support it now.)

A bug fix:
  Event attribute methods ($elem->onclick, etc.) are now listed in
  %HTML::DOM::Interface.

Another bug fix, whose description is too long to put here. (Look in
the Changes file.)
