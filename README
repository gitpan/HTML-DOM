HTML::DOM, version 0.014

HTML::DOM is a Perl implementation of the HTML Document Object Model

This is an alpha release.  So far,  the level-2 core and  HTML  DOM
interfaces have been implemented, and some of the level-2 event and
style sheet interfaces.


RECENT CHANGES

0.014:
• Fixed the Makefile.PL so it installs properly and doesn’t downgrade
  CSS::DOM after installing 0.03.
• HTML::DOM->createEvent now dies if the arg passed to it is an unsup-
  ported event category.

0.013:
New features:
• HTML::DOM::Interface now indicates which members have UTF-16
  equivalents.
• Changes to conform to the Level-2 HTML DOM module (see the
  Changes file).
• HTML::DOM::Exception now has a ‘code’ method. I don’t know how I
  missed this.
• The brand new shiny default_event_handler_for method has been added.
  It makes it less cumbersome to provide default behaviours for diffe-
  rent event types.
• All HTML elements now have a click method--something from HTML 5 (I
  seem to be getting ahead of myself).
Bug fixes — see the Changes file
