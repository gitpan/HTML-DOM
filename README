HTML::DOM, version 0.017

HTML::DOM is a Perl implementation of the HTML Document Object Model

This is an alpha release.  So far,  the level-2 core and  HTML  DOM
interfaces have been implemented, and some of the level-2 event and
style sheet interfaces.


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

New features/miscellaneous changes:
• innerHTML is now writable.
• Mutation events are now  triggered  automatic-
  ally by HTML::DOM::Element’s various  get/set/
  removeAttribute(node) methods. It does not yet
  happen with the shorthand methods (those named
  after  the  attributes;  aka  the  DOM Level 0
  interface).
• Modification of the contents of a text or comment node now triggers
  a DOMCharacterDataModified event.
• The EventTarget interface is now a separate module from Node, so
  that anything can inherit from it.
• Event attribute methods ($elem->onclick, etc.) have been added.
• An Attr node can now be used as an EventTarget.
• Assigning a value to an Attr node now modifies its child text node
  in place instead of replacing it.
Bug fixes--see the Changes file.
