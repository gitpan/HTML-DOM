HTML::DOM, version 0.043

HTML::DOM is a Perl implementation of the HTML Document Object Model

This is an alpha release.  So far,  the level-2 core,  HTML and event
DOM interfaces have been implemented,  and some of the level-2  style
sheet interfaces.

  loaded.

0.042

that are outside the innermost enclosing table.

0.041
-----
Bug fixes:
• A  CharacterData  node’s  data  method now stringifies its argument.
• Setting the selected attribute of an  orphaned  option  element  no
  longer causes errors.
• innerText is now listed in %HTML::DOM::Interface.
• $element->getElementsByTagName  now  ignores  the  $element  itself.
• $element->setAttribute now stringifies the value,  so  getAttribute-
  Node is no longer confused.
• cloneNode with a true argument (deep clone)  now sets the ownerDocu-
  ment properly.
• Setting a  boolean  attribute  through  the  DOM  0  interface  now
  works properly.
