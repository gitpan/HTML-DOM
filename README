HTML::DOM, version 0.016

HTML::DOM is a Perl implementation of the HTML Document Object Model

This is an alpha release.  So far,  the level-2 core and  HTML  DOM
interfaces have been implemented, and some of the level-2 event and
style sheet interfaces.


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

• The UIEvent,  MouseEvent  and  MutationEvent  interfaces have been
  added. (Mutation events for attributes and character data modified
  are not yet automatically triggered.)
• Events now have an init method that works like initEvent, but takes
  named args.
• trigger_event has been extended to allow named args specifying the
  event type and which default action to take.  It also chooses  the
  right event class and  reasonable  defaults  for  the  event  name
  passed to it.
• default_event_handler_for’s submit_button  and  reset_button  event
  types have been removed, and default default event handlers for spe-
  cific event types (i.e., default event handlers already in place by
  default)  have been replaced by another mechanism  (not part of the
  public API).
• The innerHTML has been added to HTML::DOM and HTML::DOM::Element. It
  is currently read-only.
• Triggering a form’s reset event (or calling its reset method, which
  in turn triggers the event) now actually resets the form.
