HTML::DOM, version 0.021

HTML::DOM is a Perl implementation of the HTML Document Object Model

This is an alpha release.  So far,  the  level-2  core  and  HTML  DOM
interfaces have been implemented, most of the level-2 event interfaces
and some of the level-2 style sheet interfaces.


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

• (I)frame elements now have a contentWindow attribute, which you
  can set,  although it is listed as read-only  in  H:D:Interface.
  contentDocument now uses this.
• Fixed some tests that failed on Windoze because they  relied  on  an
  LWP bug that was fixed in 5.810 (filenames in file upload fields not
  being escaped)


TO DO

- Finish Level 2 Events support (HTMLEvents)
- Finish Level 2 CSS support
- outerHTML?
- Other DOM interfaces (the rest of level 2, and level 3)
- HTML 5 stuff
- Write more complete documentation
- Write more tests
