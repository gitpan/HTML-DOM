HTML::DOM, version 0.010

HTML::DOM is a Perl implementation of the HTML Document Object Model

This is an alpha release.  So far,  the level-1 DOM interfaces and the
level-2 core interfaces have been implemented, and some of the level-2
event interfaces.


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

• HTML::DOM::Node’s trigger_event method now returns nothing. (It used
  to return the return value of the default event handler.)  As a side
  effect, this fixes a few bugs.
• The classes for HTML tables and frames have been added.
• HTML::DOM::Element now has a content_offset method.
• HTML::DOM::Element::Form now has its reset method.
• The DOM Level-2 core interfaces are now supported.
• I’ve started work on CSS features. So far, elements have a
 ‘style’ method.
• You can now access forms by using an HTML::DOM object as a hash ref.
• A checkbox’s click method now toggles the checkbox’s state.
• And bug fixes, a long list of which is to be found in the
  Changes file.

INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install this module is to use the CPAN module or
the cpan script:

    [sudo] perl -MCPAN -e "install HTML::DOM"

    [sudo] cpan HTML::DOM

Or you can use the following:

    perl Makefile.PL

This module requires perl 5.6.0 or later and the following
Perl modules:

  distribution) (tested with 3.23)
