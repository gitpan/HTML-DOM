HTML::DOM, version 0.047

HTML::DOM is a Perl implementation of the HTML Document Object Model

This is an alpha release.  So far,  the level-2 core,  HTML and event
DOM interfaces have been implemented,  and some of the level-2  style
sheet interfaces.


RECENT CHANGES

See the Changes file for the long version.

0.047
-----
Bug fix: Implicitly-closed forms were being associated with inputs in subsequent forms,  resulting in there being two  forms  that  contain
the same input  element  in  their  ->elements  and  ->inputs  arrays
(RT #65363).

0.046
-----
Bug fixes:
• Setting innerHTML and calling the insertAdjacent* methods now cause
  node lists and collections to be updated.
• Checking a radio button now causes other radio buttons in the  same
  group to become unchecked.

0.045
-----
Incompatible change: event_parent now holds a weak reference.
New feature:  weaken_response  constructor argument to indicate  that
the  HTML::DOM  object should hold a weak reference to  the  response
object.


TO DO

- Finish Level 2 CSS support
