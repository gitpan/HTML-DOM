=head1 NAME

HTML::DOM::Event::Mouse - A Perl class for HTML DOM mouse event objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides MouseEvent objects for L<HTML::DOM>, which objects are
passed to event handlers for mouse events when they are invoked.
It inherits from L<HTML::DOM::Event::UI>.

=head1 METHODS

See also those inherited from L<HTML::DOM::Event::UI> and
L<HTML::DOM::Event>.

=head2 DOM Attributes

These are all read-only and ignore their arguments.

=over

=item screenX

=item screenY

=item clientX

=item clientY

This represent the coordinates within the screen or window (viewport),
respectively, of the mouse event.

=item ctrlKey

=item shiftKey

=item altKey

=item metaKey

These are booleans that indicate which modifier keys were pressed when the
event occurred.

=item button

A number representing the mouse button: 0 for the left (or the right button
on a left-handed mouse), 1 for the middle and 2 for the right (or left).

=item relatedTarget

References a node which, though it is not the target, was involved in the
event somehow. This is typically used for C<mouseover> events and indicates
the node that the mouse moved off.

=back

=head2 Other Methods

=over

=item initMouseEvent ( $name, $propagates_up, $cancellable, $view, $detail, $screen_x, $screen_y, $client_x, $client_y, $ctrl_key, $alt_key, $shift_key, $meta_key, $button, $related_target )

This initialises the event object. See L<HTML::DOM::Event/initEvent> for
more detail.

=item init ( ... )

Alternative to C<initMouseEvent> that's easier to use:

  init $event
      type => $type,
      propagates_up => 1,
      cancellable => 1,
      view => $view,
      detail => 1,
      screen_x => $foo,
      screen_y => $bar,
      client_x => $baz,
      client_y => $oto,
      ctrl     => $bop,
      alt      => 0,
      shift    => 0,
      meta     => 0,
      button   => 1,
      rel_target => $other_elem,
  ;
